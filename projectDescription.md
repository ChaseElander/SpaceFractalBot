# SpaceFractalBot Project Description


## Overview

I (Chase Elander) propose SpaceFractalBot as a twitter bot that will post images of distored NASA copywrite free images to twitter. To achieve this, it will have to retrieve the images, store them, apply mathematical functions to processthe images into the desired character of imagry, have a functioning twitter bot, plan to post regularly. Tweets will link to the original photo hosted on the nasa.gov webpage. It is designed to interest people in Space, NASA, image processing, and mathematical concepts of beauty. It is helpful that it is also interesting to me and I desire for more images of this style to exist for use as backgrounds for my computer.

## Plan

I (Chase Elander) am creating the various systems required for the effective running of SpaceFractalBot, a twitter bot that posts processed images of space. I will be using Github as a version control platform, as well as for the ongoing documentation of the project and the process of creating the project. I have created this repository for the project to host the project and it will continue to be used as a basis for project management. Within the repository, I will keep track of progress on individual tasks.

The systems rewuired for this project are several, and I will be approaching them one at a time in controlled spaces before merging them. Distorting images using mathematical functions will be my first system to approach. Data storage and retrieval will be implemented next. A DBMS may be required to keep track of original/distorted images and the corresponding webpages associated. The Twitter bot API will be one of my final steps.
